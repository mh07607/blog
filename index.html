    <p>Aight, so what exactly do I want to do here? I want to document some of my thoughts and progress in projects. This can be something like a accountability tool for me. I have a habit of making great progress in a day and then doing nothing for months. This task every month should at least make me feel ashamed for the weeks in which I can show nothing for myself.</p>
